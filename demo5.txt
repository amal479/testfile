Long ago, in a forgotten corner of the world, there was a city called Veloria, famed for its grand architecture and the wisdom of its scholars. Nestled between towering mountains and vast, uncharted forests, Veloria was the heart of an ancient empire that spanned thousands of miles. Its people were known for their art, philosophy, and advanced technology, which far surpassed that of any neighboring kingdom.
But one fateful night, a violent storm swept across the land, leaving nothing but destruction in its wake. The winds howled like creatures in torment, and the sky cracked open with bolts of lightning that lit up the heavens. When the storm finally subsided, Veloria was gone.
Legends say the city did not fall to nature’s fury alone; it was said that the storm had been summoned by the city's own inhabitants, desperate to protect their most prized possession—the Oracle of Eternity. The Oracle, an ancient device that granted immense power, had fallen into the wrong hands, and the city’s council, fearing the consequences, decided to sacrifice Veloria to stop its misuse.
In the years that followed, explorers, adventurers, and treasure hunters flocked to the region, eager to uncover the secrets of the lost city. Some claimed to have glimpsed its ruins at the heart of the storm’s wrath, while others vanished into the forests, never to return.
Among the hopeful was a young woman named Lyra, the daughter of a historian who had dedicated his life to studying the ancient city. Armed with only a map passed down through generations, Lyra ventured into the forest. She braved harsh terrains and faced mythical creatures guarding the city’s secrets.
One day, as she ventured deeper into the forgotten lands, Lyra stumbled upon a hidden temple covered in vines. There, inside, was the Oracle, still glowing with an otherworldly light. As she reached out to touch it, a voice echoed in her mind, warning her of the dangers of wielding such power.
Lyra hesitated, realizing that some treasures were meant to remain lost.
